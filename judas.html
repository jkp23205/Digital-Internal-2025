      About Judas
    </h3>

             <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;" class="homepagetext">
            Judas Iscariot was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus. Although originally held a great loyalty to Jesus, his name became associated with betrayal after Jesus' arrest in the Garden of Gethsmane. Within the twelve apostles, he held the role of being their treasurer, responsible for their finances at the time. John 13:29 says "Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor." Soon enough, Judas had traded his loyalty for silver. </p>

    Role In Jesus' Life
  </h3>


    <p class="homepagetext" style="margin-right: 5vw; margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 7vw;"> In Matthew 26:49-50, which said "So he went right up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him. “Friend,” Jesus asked him, “why have you come?” Then they came up, took hold of Jesus, and arrested Him." This action of course, changed the course of Jesus' life. It was the action which had fully displayed Judas' greed for wealth and his disloyalty to Jesus. In Matthew 26:15 the Bible says "and said, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” So they weighed out 30 pieces of silver for him." Where Judas had been aware of the Roman Soldiers' distaste for Jesus, he assisted them with their orchestrated arrest in Matthews 26:50. </p>

      Opposing the Gospel
    </h3>

             <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;" class="homepagetext">
            In the Bible, there are ten commandments. An old-school list of morals and rules to follow. Judas did much more than give into the temptation of greed, but he outright disobeyed the fifth commandment: "honor yout father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving to you." Sure, Jesus wasn't Judas' biological father. But being older, wiser, and the son of God himself he treated Judas as his own son, the same way God treats everyone as his own children. Judas' greed was deeper than just money, but breaches the moral code of loyalty and family. </p>

      <div class="pagecaption3">

          <p class="homepagetext" style="margin-bottom: -1vw; margin-top: -0.8vw; font-family: Roboto Condensed, sans-serif; font-style: normal; color: white;"> Yes, everyone knows greed is a bad enough sin, and so is disloyalty. Nothing in the Bible dissuades that. However Judas' actions and morals were not only a betrayal towards Jesus, but to the Gospel, to God, and to himself. He not only threw away the man that loved him unconditionally, he also threw away his love and devotion to the God and his word. At the end of it all, he hung himself from the utter sadness of his choices. So from this, choose God, choose loyalty, and love, from this, you are choosing yourself. </p>
