      About Mary
    </h3>

             <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;" class="homepagetext">
            In Mary's earlier days, she was a prostitute. A jewish woman who lived in the town of Magdala near the Sea of Galilee. She wasn't a follower of Jesus, at least not originally. But she was a woman in need of redeption, as did many other sinners. Luke 8:2 states "and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;". In Luke 8, Jesus was said to be travelling from village to village, healing the sick, and helping the poor. From this, she became one of Jesus' most loyal followers. </p>

    Role In Female Discipleship
  </h3>


    <p class="homepagetext" style="margin-right: 5vw; margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 7vw;"> There were many female disciples of Jesus, none less of a person than the other. However being the first to witness Jesus' ressurection, Mary Magdalene changed the course of female discipleship for people at that point in time, and even for women today. Before life with Jesus, she was a well-known outcast. However after experiencing Jesus' love, redemption and witnessing Him perform miracles on her, she changed. She became devoted, loyal, and was shaped into the woman God wanted her to be. in John 12:3 the Bible says "Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume." Through this alone, we can see Mary's loyalty to Jesus. Everyone knows that washing someone's feet, let alone with your own hair isn't exactly pleasant. But she did it, because all she wanted was for Jesus to know how devoted she was to Him. This shows us that women with misinterpreted pasts can be shaped into women that Jesus wants them to be. And despite our past, he will want us either way, because one way or another he chases after our hearts. </p>

      Women In The Gospel
    </h3>

             <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;" class="homepagetext">
            Throughout history, and even in parts of the modern world, women were treated as objects of lust. A means of pleasure, a way to rise higher in society, or merely just second-place holders. However, Jesus was admant about the equality between men and women, his sons and daughters. To Him, we are all the same. Sinners through nature. He saw through Mary's past, and saw who she really was, a lover at heart. A woman who pledged loyalty to Him. Besides her history, Mary was the first person on Earth to witness Jesus' ressurection after the cross. Being the first to bring the good news, she sought people out, cried to them, and told him of his ressurection. God doesn't just adore women, but he uses them to spread the good word of the gospel, and builds them up to become the best version of themselves. </p>

          <p class="homepagetext" style="margin-bottom: -1vw; margin-top: -0.8vw; font-family: Roboto Condensed, sans-serif; font-style: normal; color: white;"> Being given a fresh start at life is one thing, but being redeemed by Jesus' hands Himself is another. Mary Magdalene's life is the kind of life you'd stay away from. Dangerous, used, and outcasted by other civilians. And you'd think that's all she would be, given her age too. But of course, Jesus thinks otherwise. No matter who you are, what you've done and what you think you're subjected to, he always has a better plan for your life. Whether king, or slave, janitor or CEO, whether you have your life laid out for you or not, the Lord will always have a plan for you, and there will always be a second and better chance. He wants our hearts after all, doesn't he? </p>
