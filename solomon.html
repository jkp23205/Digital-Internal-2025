      About Solomon
    </h3>

             <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;" class="homepagetext">
             Son of King David, the man who founded the Judaean Dynasty, and son of Lady Bathsheba, the former wife of her husband's soldier, Uriah. He was well-known, wealthy, and had a good head on his shoulders. In 1 Kings 4:29 the Bible says "And God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore." From this we can understand that God gave Solomon the gift of wisdom, and the ability to write, understand and curate important parts of the Bible and understand the Gospel and God's word. With this wisdom, he built the Jerusalem temple and wrote the books Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. </p>

      Role in Israeli History
    </h3>

             <p style="margin-left: 5vw; margin-right: 5vw;" class="homepagetext">
            Besides writing three books of the Bible, he was the long-reigning king of Israel, ruling over the kingdom of Israel for 40 years. Known for his wealth, he brought economic value to Israel, growing their wealth and trade. After building the first temple of Jerusalem, he continued to build monuments and structures outside of his own kingdom. 1 Kings 9:15 says "Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the Lord's temple, his own palace, the terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer." Solomon was also very well known for his large builds, and archaeology is a witness to it all. </p>

    Shaping the Gospel
  </h3>


    <p class="homepagetext" style="margin-right: 5vw; margin-left: 5vw; margin-bottom: 7vw;"> King Solomon was credited in three books of the Bible. Proverbs, Song of Songs and and Ecclesiastes. Proverbs is a book of wisdom, where Solomon writes about his own life experiences, and practical life lessons. In terms of writing, the structure is unique as most of the book is Solomon's individual thoughts and statements rather than focal points. Song of Songs is also known as the Song of Solomon. Where "Song of Songs" is a more literal translation from the original Hebrew name, "Song of Solomon" displays more about the author's identity. King Solomon was a charming man, and had mnany experiences with love, lust and women. This book is a collection of his own personal experiences with love, and his own personal views on love, but with God's wisdom it transformed into a book of love between God and His relationship with us. As for Ecclesiastes, it is known to be one of the most difficult books to understand, as on the surface it seems as if Solomon questioned God. To get things straight, he is a believer and follower of God. All in all, Ecclesiastes is a book which explores the topic of earthly pursuits and, and how at the end of the day, God is what mattters. </p>

          <p class="homepagetext" style="margin-bottom: -1vw; margin-top: -0.8vw; font-family: Roboto Condensed, sans-serif; font-style: normal; color: white;"> Solomon asked for wisdom, and God gave him more than he could ask for. Yes, he was wise, but he wrote three of the most important books of the Bible. He provided wisdom to people for generations to come, he wrote about his own love, and with God's help, he transformed it into a book of love between God and his people. God always provides, for some people he gives them what they ask for. For others, he gives them something they couldn't dream of asking for. God always provides, and ne not only provided Solomon with wisdom, but gave the people of Israel a good king, and provided further generations with wisdom straight from God. </p>
